In conclusion, the accuracy of this window extraction function is 0.92, which means among the 141 patients' notes, this method identifies 131 patients' notes correctly. The sensitivity is 0.79, and the specificity is 0.95, separately. I feel satisfied with the outcome, and it definitely saves much more time and easy to scale up for a large data set.
